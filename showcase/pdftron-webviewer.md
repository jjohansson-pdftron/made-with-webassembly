WebViewer is a WebAssembly-based SDK that brings PDF, MS Office, and video capabilities to web apps. View, annotate, edit, automate, and more. At its simplest you can view a document by passing WebViewer a document URL and a DOM element where WebViewer will be placed inside your app.

WebViewer takes advantage of client side technologies like WebAssembly to quickly parse and render documents or videos completely in the browser with no server necessary.

WebViewer supports PDF “Fast Web View” or Linearization, making it possible to stream large documents into a client application in similar fashion to Youtube videos. 2GB files open in 7 seconds on average when using a mobile device connected to a 4G connection.
